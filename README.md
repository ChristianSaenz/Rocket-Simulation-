Overview:

The Rocket Launch Simulation project is a Java-based desktop application that provides a visual and interactive simulation of rocket launches. Designed for both educational and entertainment purposes, the project showcases the physics and dynamics of rocketry, allowing users to initiate and control rocket launches while observing a variety of flight parameters in real time.

Features:

Real-time Simulation: Simulate rocket launches in real-time, visualizing the ascent and reset of rockets.

User Interaction: User interface with buttons to launch and abort the simulation, providing an interactive experience.

Customizable Rocket Types: Support for two different rocket types with distinct properties, allowing users to explore the two scenarios.

Flight Data Visualization: On-screen display of altitude, velocity, acceleration, thrust, and fuel metrics that update dynamically during the simulation.

Physics-based Dynamics: Incorporates basic physics principles to calculate and display the motion of rockets.

Data Handling:

Manual Data Entry: Users can manually initiate rocket launches, simulating the behavior of solid and liquid fuel rockets based on predefined physics formulas.
Tools Used:

Java Swing: To create the graphical user interface and render the simulation's visual elements.

Object-Oriented Programming: Utilized to structure the simulation logic, ensuring modularity and extensibility of the codebase.

Timers and Threads: To manage the real-time aspects of the simulation and ensure a responsive user experience without freezing the UI.

Math and Physics Calculations: Essential for accurately simulating the rocket's flight dynamics according to physical laws.
