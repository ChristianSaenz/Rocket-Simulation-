I created this project in January 2024 and wanted to create a bridge between my interest in physics and my interest in programming. This was my way of bringing those together I had to use some of my physics background to build the classes and logic of the Rockert class as well as the specific rocket information regarding the two different types of rockets I had set. 
This project  helped with better understanding Java UI libraries and manipulating them to show the relationship between the rockets and updating their movement along the way. This led to one of the biggest struggles I had with this project and that was at times the classes and logic of my rocket attributes were correct, but it didn't always mean that it would work perfectly with the UI aspect.
A perfect example was that I wanted the abort button to bring the rocket down and keep track of attitude, velocity, acceleration, etc. However, I wasn't able to get this functionality to work because no matter how many times I looked back at the class logic and methods for implementing the rocket to come down the UI aspect in my case Java Swing would not correspond with it which eventually led me to simply the project as I wanted to continue on others and possibly going back at a later time to implement this project on a web application.
